  `Henlo! I am a 3 year-old sassy, female forever-pup who lives in Los Angeles. 
        I enjoy splooting, heccin' at the beach, and eating anything edible (and sometimes inedible). 
        My life may sound relaxing, but it is not without facing dangers such as the vacuum, introoders, and printers. 
        Luckily,  I can easily keep everyone safe from these evil things by barking as loud as possible. Thanks to my efforts, no human has ever been injured.`,
  `When I am not napping, I am hard at work as the chief corgi officer of a multi-bajillion dollar company I founded. 
    My hired staff includes mahm and dad. Mahm is the chief marketing officer and responsible for handling all my social media. 
    Dad, my intern and assistant, is responsible for several butler-like services such as feeding me dinner and picking up my poop.`,
